          <h2><br>Roblox: Entry Point:</h2><p><a href = "#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p>Entry Point is an FPS game which means that it is a shooting/shooter game that is played in first person. In Entry Point there is a set objective of beating the mission in difficulties ranging from Rookie to Legend <i>(Rookie, Professional, Operative, Elite and Legend in order of difficulty)</i>. How you complete the mission is up to you. Provided that you finish the mission, you can do whatever you want. However the game is relativaly forgiving. If you fail a mission, you die and and lose a bit of money depending on the difficulty that you chose. The only exeption to this is the Ironman gamemode. The Ironman gamemode is where you play through the 8 story missions in chronological order and each mission will get a bit harder as you go on. Dying would result in failing the entire thing and forcing you either restart from the start <i>(There are no saves)</i> or give up. <br><br>

            <br><br>The game also currently has 6 gamepasses that unlock a few DLCs in the game. The Extended Customization gamepass costs 35 robux and unlocks a few extra customization for your characters. The Double Experience gamepass which costs 300 robux does just that. It doubles your experience which <i>(from experience myself(pun intended))</i> makes leveling up your characters a lot easier. The Legends gamepass which costs 750 robux unlocks 6 extra character slots for a total of 12. It also increases your level cap from 75 for free-to-play to 100 for the people that payed for this gamepass giving you a slight advantage. <br>

            <br><br><br>The Expanded Arsenal gamepass which costs 100 robux unlocks 8 extra gun slots for a total of 16 and gives you access to 2 extra gun. The Raven <i>(a deagle)</i> which is in the opinions of most of the best players to be the worst gun in the game. It also unlocks the MM20 <i>(a modified Kriss Vector)</i> a burst sub-machine gun that is considered to be the best gun in the game and if it had more ammo would be so good that it could be considered to be brokenly good. The last 2 gamepasses <i>(The Night Heists (800 robux) and The Freelancer Heists (1200 robux))</i> both unlock 3 mission each. However you do not need to the gamepasses to play the mission. If someone with the gamepass makes a lobby for you, you can join their lobby and play the mission. Me bring the compete no-life at Entry Point that I am, I own all the gamepasses.<br><br><img src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773377728690389012/867169044460208138/profile_pic.png" alt = "Agent Kenshin YT icon" height = "200px" width = "200px" class = "kenshinicon" >

I am simply talking about it.</h2><br><p><a href = "#top">Back to top</a></p> <h1 class = "spoiler">SPOILER WARNING!!!</h1>
      
      
    <p>I'm going to talk about the books in the order-ish that I read them. I read them in the order of <i> The Prophecies Begin, The New prophecy, The Power of Three, The Omen of the Stars, The Dawn of the Clans, The Vision of Shadows </i>and then<i> The Broken Code.</i> I have read a few of the special editions but I'm not going to name them all.</p>

        <li><h3><a href = "#tpb">The Prophecies Begin</a></h3></li>
        <li><h3><a href = "#tnp">The New Prophecy</a></h3></li>
        <li><h3><a href = "#tpof">The Power of Three</a></h3></li>
        <li><h3><a href = "#oots">Omen of the Stars</a></h3></li>
      </ol>
   <div class = "books">     
    <p id = "tpb"><b>So... The Prophecies Begin.</b><br> I'm going to rate it a 8.5/10. It is one of the best series' in my opinion. It goes into a lot of detail about the clan life and teaches you about how it's supposed to work. It also shows a lot of the potitial of the Warrriors series and leads up to a lot of what happens in the later sub-series.</p><br>
    
    <p id = "tnp"><b>The New Prophecy</b><br>This series is not one that I particularly like. I don't feel like enough is happening. However it is still alright. I find it intresting that the clans have to move back to where they essentially came from to escape all of them dying.</p>
    
    <p id = "tpot"><b>The Power of Three</b><br>This is probably my second favorite series after The Prophecies Begin. I really like this sub-series because it is the most intresting. For example Jayfeather, one of my favorite characters, had the ablilty to walk in anyones dream and see their memories (Pre-The Battle of The Dark Forest). So much fun stuff just happens in this sub-series that it is really well writen.</p>
    
    <p id = "oots"><b>The Omen of the Stars</b><br>Omen of the Stars is alright. Could be better, could be worse. It's kinda like The New Prophecy, where there doesn't feel like there's enough happening. I mean like Dovewing's powers are cool and all but she doesn't do much with them until the very end and immediately loses them because the batter is over. She mostly used them to meet with Tigerheart and to stay out of trouble, not that she's very good at that, but still.</p>
